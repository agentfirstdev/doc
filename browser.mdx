## Usage

**Agent First’s** browser service navigates intelligently on your behalf, rendering JavaScript,
solving [CAPTCHAs](https://www.ibm.com/topics/captcha), and retrying failed requests. The service
has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&zwj;api.agentfirst.dev/browser**.

Webpages can be localized with [geotargeting parameters](geotargeting). They’re retrieved in real
time by default or optionally queued for [later retrieval](scheduling). Up to **120 seconds** is
allotted per real-time API call to accommodate CAPTCHA-solving, multiple retries, and other
mitigations.

### Browsing parameters

Besides the [geotargeting and scheduling parameters](#usage) linked above, required and optional
browsing parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values **Agent First** supports are as follows:

| Key           | Required | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`         | ✅       | The URL of the page to browse; any unsafe characters require [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding)                                                                                                     |
| `device`      | ⬜       | The name as returned by the [devices endpoint](#device-emulation) of the device to emulate browsing on (these names are case insensitive but must include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); device emulation is unused by default |
| `ip`          | ⬜       | The type of IP address to browse from, `residential`, `isp`, or `datacenter`; `residential` is the default IP type                                                                                                                                  |
| `format`      | ⬜       | The HTML format to output to, `rendered` or `raw` (see [details below](#response-format)); `rendered` is the default format                                                                                                                         |
| `expiration`  | ⬜       | The maximum age of cached content in days to accept, where `0` will disable caching; `1` is the default number of days                                                                                                                              |
| `delay`       | ⬜       | The number of seconds to inject before snapshotting the browsed content, from `.1` to `10` inclusive; no delay is injected by default                                                                                                               |
| `session`     | ⬜       | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters (regardless of character encoding); **Agent First** will make best efforts to route calls in the same session to the same egress node                                                                 |
| `subaccount`  | ⬜       | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters (regardless of character encoding); **Agent First** will bill calls made from subaccounts separately                                                                                                  |

### Device emulation

The `device` parameter lets you fetch device-specific content, rather than the default desktop
content. For a list of supported smartphone and tablet devices, make a request with your API token
and no parameters to **https://&zwj;api.agentfirst.dev/browser/devices**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_FIRST_TOKEN" \
  'https://api.agentfirst.dev/browser/devices'
```

The API will return JSON that contains an alphabetized array of device names:

```json
[
  "Blackberry PlayBook",
  "Blackberry PlayBook landscape",
  "BlackBerry Z30",
  "[Remaining device names here]"
]
```

Then, pass your device name of choice in to your browsing request:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_FIRST_TOKEN" \
  'https://api.agentfirst.dev/browser'\
  '?url=https://crackberry.com/'\
  '&device=blackberry+playbook'
```

### Response format

Pages are returned as rendered HTML or raw (unrendered) HTML.
