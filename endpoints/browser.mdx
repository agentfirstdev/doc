## Usage

**{companyName}'s** browser service navigates intelligently on your behalf, rendering JavaScript,
solving [captchas](https://www.ibm.com/topics/captcha), and retrying failed requests. The service
has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&zwj;{apiEndpoint}/browser**.

Webpages can be localized with <Link href='geotargeting'>geotargeting parameters</Link>. They're
retrieved in real time by default or optionally queued for <Link href='scheduling'>subsequent
retrieval</Link>. Up to **2 minutes** is allotted per real-time API call to accommodate
captcha-solving, multiple retries, and other mitigations. <Link href='reporting'>Usage data</Link>
is published regularly.

<Tip>
  If a website you're targeting remains blocked, even with different browsing parameters, <a
  href={`mailto:${emailAddress}`}>let us know</a>. We can usually help unblock any website within
  **48 hours**.

### Browsing parameters

Besides the [geotargeting and scheduling parameters](#usage) linked above, required and optional
browsing parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values **{companyName}** supports are as follows:

| Key          | Required | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`        | ✅       | The URL of the page to browse; any unsafe characters require [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding)                                                                                                              |
| `difficulty` | ⬜       | The difficulty pool to attempt to access the page from, `high` (coming soon), `medium`, or `low`; `low` is the default difficulty                                                                                                                            |
| `speed`      | ⬜       | The speed to attempt to access the page at, `light`, `ridiculous`, or `ludicrous` (planned), where `ridiculous` is 30 percent faster on average than `light`; `light` is the default speed                                                                   |
| `device`     | ⬜       | The name as returned by the [devices endpoint](#device-emulation) of the device to emulate browsing the page on (these names are case insensitive but must include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); device emulation is unused by default |
| `ip`         | ⬜       | The type of IP address to browse the page from, `residential`, `isp`, or `datacenter` (planned); a random IP type is used by default                                                                                                                         |
| `readiness`  | ⬜       | The standard ready event to await before snapshotting browsed content, `load` or `domcontentloaded`; `load` is the default event                                                                                                                             |
| `delay`      | ⬜       | The number of additional seconds to delay before snapshotting browsed content, from `.1` to `10` inclusive; no delay is added by default                                                                                                                     |
| `expiration` | ⬜       | The age in days to consider cached content expired, where `0` disables caching; `1` is the default number of days before expiration                                                                                                                          |
| `format`     | ⬜       | The HTML format to output to, `rendered` or `raw` (see the [section below](#response-format)); `rendered` is the default format                                                                                                                              |

### Device emulation

The `device` parameter lets you fetch device-specific content, rather than the default desktop
content. For a list of supported smartphone and tablet devices, make a request with your API token
and no parameters to **https://&zwj;{apiEndpoint}/browser/devices**:

<Devices />

The API will return JSON that contains an alphabetized array of device names:

```json
[
  "Blackberry PlayBook",
  "Blackberry PlayBook landscape",
  "BlackBerry Z30",
  "[Remaining device names here]"
]
```

Then, pass your device name of choice in to your browsing request:

<Device />

### Sticky sessions

To reuse a browser session across requests, set a cookie named `session`:

<Session />

The cookie value can be any unique identifier of up to **255 characters** (regardless of character
encoding) and **{companyName}** will make best efforts to route calls in the same session to the
same egress node for up to **12 minutes**.

### Response format

Pages are returned as rendered HTML or raw (unrendered) HTML.
