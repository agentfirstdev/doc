## Consumption data

You can monitor hourly metrics by specifying start and end dates or times:

<Dates />

<Accordion icon='terminal' title='View time-range example'>
  <Datetimes />
</Accordion>

The API will return a JSON report:

```json
[{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "from": "2025-12-24T00:00:00+00:00",
  "to": "2025-12-25T00:00:00+00:00",
  "service": "browser",
  "result": "success",
  "calls": 17208,
  "meanSecs": 6.78
}, {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "from": "2025-12-24T07:00:00+00:00",
  "to": "2025-12-24T15:00:00+00:00",
  "service": "browser",
  "result": "failure",
  "calls": 18,
  "meanSecs": 60.22
}]
```

You can also filter the metrics by one or more services:

<Service />

  <Services />
