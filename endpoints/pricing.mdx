## Credit system

API accounting is credit based. **{companyName}** charges only for successful API calls. Most calls
cost **1 credit** apiece or are **free**:

| Endpoint  | Base credits   |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| `search`  | **1 per call** |
| `browser` | **1 per call** |
| `usage`   | **0 (free)**   |
| `users`   | **0 (free)**   |

A few premium parameters multiply the base cost of calls that use them:

| Endpoint  | Key          | Value        | Credit multiplier |
| :-------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------------- |
| `browser` | `difficulty` | `medium`     | **2**             |
| `browser` | `speed`      | `ridiculous` | **1.5**           |

For example, successfully calling the `browser` endpoint with both `difficulty=medium` and
`speed=ridiculous` params would cost:

> **1 base credit × 2 × 1.5 = 3 credits**
