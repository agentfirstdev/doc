The API runs on a credit system. **{companyName}** charges for successful API calls only. Most calls
cost **1 or 0 credits**:

| Endpoint  | Base credits |
| :-------- | :----------- |
| `search`  | **1/call**   |
| `browser` | **1/call**   |
| `usage`   | **0 (free)** |
| `users`   | **0 (free)** |

A few premium parameters multiply the cost of calls that include them:

| Endpoint  | Key          | Value        | Credits multiplier |
| :-------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------------- |
| `browser` | `difficulty` | `medium`     | **2**              |
| `browser` | `speed`      | `ridiculous` | **1.5**            |

For example, successfully calling the `browser` endpoint with both `difficulty=medium` and
`speed=ridiculous` params would cost **1 base credit × 2 × 1.5 = 3 credits**.
