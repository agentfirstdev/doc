## Credit system

Access to **{companyName}** services is based on prepaid credits. Your credit balance is decremented
only for successful API calls. Most calls cost **1 credit** each or are **free**:

| Service                             | Base credits |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------- |
| <Link href='search'>Search</Link>   | 1            |
| <Link href='browser'>Browser</Link> | 1            |
| <Link href='usage'>Reporting</Link> | 0 (free)     |
| Administration                      | 0 (free)     |

A few premium parameters multiply the base cost of calls that use them:

| Service | Key          | Value        | Credit multiplier |
| :------ | :----------- | :----------- | :---------------- |
| Browser | `difficulty` | `medium`     | 2                 |
| Browser | `speed`      | `ridiculous` | 1.5               |

For example, calling the browser service successfully with both `difficulty=medium` and
`speed=ridiculous` params would cost **3 credits** in total:

<Latex>1 base credit x 2 x 1.5 = 3 total credits</Latex>
