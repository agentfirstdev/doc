## New users

You can provision a user by specifying their email address and the API services to assign them
access permission:

<Email />

The user’s secret API token will be returned, along with the their normalized email address and
permitted services:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "token": "a1-0dF6qKHYD7SNU5kAtjOmwHpH3iFgpylA",
  "services": ["search", "browser"]
}
```

Here are the available provisioning keys and values:
